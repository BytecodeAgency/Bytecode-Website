				Many tech start-up founders like you are trying to find the right tech person to develop their MVP.
				But finding one is a treasure hunt. Outsourcing is time-consuming, agencies are expensive,
				and tech founders are rare and difficult to retain. Besides, outsourcing companies and agencies like your money,
