# TODO

## Release June 9th, 2019 (finished for QA June 7th, 2019)

### Blocking issues Julian

* Make sure all forms are still working // api has to be fixed.
* Update .travis.yml // Nothing really changed Export should catch all linting errors, added `yarn run test` tho
* Research page transitions // Can be done with: https://transitionlink.tylerbarnes.ca/docs/transitionlink/ looks really obstrusive tho, maybe good for a short responsive animation

### Blocking issues Luciano

* Configure production server

## Release TBD

* Add RSS feed functionality
* Add PWA functionality (see gatsby-config.js file)
* Where possible, abstract the Gatsby API to make future framework switches less painful
* Update documentation from Next to Gatsby
