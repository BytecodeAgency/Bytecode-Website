# Bytecode component library

The Bytecode component library architecture is inspired by [The Commonground Design System](https://gitlab.com/commonground/core/design-system) which is licensed under the GPL compatible EUPL licence.

## Installation

run `yarn` in the root directory (one up from here).

Note that this package assumes fonts exist in the browser/website environment and thus are not exported outside of this package.

## Development

run `yarn run dev` in the root directory to run the bytecode website project. It will automatically hot-reload code changes in /components and /website.

### Component library development

run `yarn run storybook` to develop component separatly within storybook.

## TODO

1. Integrate all fonts
2. Integrate icons
